So a one-year-old dog is 10.5 years old in human years, and a two-year-old dog is 21 years old in human yearsâ€¦ hmm this is about to get more complicated. Before you start doing the math in your head, let a computer take care of it!
Write a Swift program in DogYears.swift to calculate the age, in human years, of any dog older than 2.
